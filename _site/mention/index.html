    “True discipline is remembering and recovering - inventing 
    if necessary - what interests you. It it doesn’t interest
    *you*, how could it possibly interest anyone else?”
    - Verlyn Klinkenborg

  <h1>Mention</h1>
  <p>
    2014 Summer <br />
    ios
  </p>
  <p>
  Mention was an exploratory prototype that gave people a way to send a thought to select friends.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through an iterative design process, we (Caret Labs) tested our underlying assumptions about text-based communication. Our findings became the underpinnings of an app to follow named <a href="/jot">Jot</a>.
  </p>
  <p>I designed and built Mention from concept to full prototype in a period of 1 month and continued to iterate on it for 2 months thereafter.
  </p>
  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <p>I'll use these words throughout this document:
  <ul>
    <li>Networks: communication services, generally social</li>
    <li>Messaging: networks deisgned around private 1 to 1</li>
    <li>Broadcasting: networks for 1 to many or 1 to all</li>
    <li>Publishing: syn. for broadcasting</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Motivations</h2>
  <p>
    In 2014, I noticed myself increasingly using messaging apps to send ideas and links to friends <strong>instead of posting on broadcasting networks</strong>. And it seemed to me that my friends were doing the same.
  </p>
  <p><i>Why were we doing this?</i></p>
  <h3>Context</h3>
  <p>
    Massive social networks dominated the landscape. They were arenas full of posts fighting for attention. Friend graphs and follower graphs were bloated. User profiles chronicled a decade worth of posts. Our profiles were our avatars – a collection of posts that painted a picture of our digital selves. And they were being manicured and polished with precision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Messaging was becoming a dominant behavior. Alternative broadcasting networks were growing. Snapchat. YikYak. Facebook Messenger.
  </p>
  <h2>Designing Mention</h2>
  <p>
  After many <a href="">rabbit holes of research</a>, informal surveys, and long internal conversations, it became clear that people had moved and were continuing to move much of their broadcasting behavior from the incumbent networks. 
  </p>
  <h3>Working Theory</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Caret Lab's Theory</strong>
    Publishing on incumbent networks had become burdensome: these networks merged many different contexts of our lives into one; our profiles were permanent histories documenting our lives for anyone to crawl.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Our broadcast networks felt heavy.</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Control who receives each message</li>
      <li>Thoughts live for one day</li>
      <li>No likes, no follower counts</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2>
    Outcomes
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Selective send was not a feature people found useful</li>
    <li>Conversations that emerged within the thread became the focal point of the app</li>
    <li>Mention became Jot, an app centered around fast, spontaneous conversations</li>
  </ul>
