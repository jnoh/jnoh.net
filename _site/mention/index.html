    “True discipline is remembering and recovering - inventing 
    if necessary - what interests you. It it doesn’t interest
    *you*, how could it possibly interest anyone else?”
    - Verlyn Klinkenborg

  <h1>Mention</h1>
  <p>
    2014 <br />
    ios
  </p>
  <p>
  Mention was an exploratory prototype by <a href="https://www.caretlabs.co">Caret Labs</a> that gave people a way to send a thought to select friends. It explored questions about broadcast communication and finding levity in an era of aging digital profiles. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Our findings became the underpinnings of an app to follow named <a href="/jot">Jot</a>.
  </p>
  <p>I designed and built Mention from concept to full prototype in a period of 1 month and continued to iterate on it for 2 months thereafter.
  </p>
  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <p>Words that I'll be using and how I'll be using them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Networks: communication services, generally social</li>
    <li>Messaging: networks designed around private 1 to 1</li>
    <li>Broadcasting: networks for 1 to many or 1 to all</li>
    <li>Publishing: syn. for broadcasting</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Motivations</h2>
  <p>
    In 2014, I noticed my friends and I were increasingly using messaging apps to send ideas and links to friends instead of posting on broadcasting networks.
  </p>
  <p><i>Why were we doing this?</i></p>
  <p><strong>Our broadcast networks felt heavy.</strong></p>
  <p>
    At Caret Labs, our user research indicated that other people were moving broadcasting behavior from the incumbent networks as well. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Massive social networks dominated the landscape. They were arenas full of posts fighting for attention. Friend graphs and follower graphs were bloated. User profiles chronicled a decade worth of posts. Our profiles were our avatars – a collection of posts that painted a picture of our digital selves. And they were being manicured and polished with precision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Messaging was becoming a dominant behavior. Alternative broadcasting networks were growing. Snapchat. YikYak. Facebook Messenger.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Caret Lab's Theory</strong>
    Publishing on incumbent networks had become burdensome: these networks merged many different contexts of our lives into one; our profiles were permanent histories documenting our lives for anyone to crawl.
  </p>

  <h2>The Prototype</h2>
  <p>
    What would an app look like that was explicitly designed for levity of publishing?
  </p>


  <h3>Design Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Control who receives each message</li>
    <li>Thoughts live for one day</li>
    <li>No likes, no follower counts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    Outcomes
  </h2>
  <p>
    Mention was fast. Conversations happened quickly even for new users with few friends.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Selective send was not a feature people found useful</li>
    <li>Conversations that emerged within the thread became the focal point of the app</li>
    <li>Mention became Jot, an app centered around fast, spontaneous conversations</li>
  </ul>
